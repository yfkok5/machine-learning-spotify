## 1. Introduction
This respository applies machine learning to data from the Spotify API. The data includes a number of playlists which were compiled based on 3 distinct genres, which are:
* Jazz
* House
* RnB

We also have data which is a list of Ryan's top 20 favourite songs, to which we applied NLP and Sentiment Analysis. 

The results are outlined below.

See instructions for how to use this repsitory at the end of the README.
