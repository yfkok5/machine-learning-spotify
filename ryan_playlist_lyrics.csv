The end

The songwriter's dead
The blade fell upon him
Taking him to the white lands
Of empathica
Of innocence
Empathica
Innocence

[II. Home]

The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widowed writer torn apart by chains of hell

One last perfect verse
Is still the same old song
Oh Christ how I hate what I have become

Take me home

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world

My home was there 'n then
Those meadows of heaven
Adventure-filled days
One with every smiling face

Please, no more words
Thoughts from a severed head
No more praise
Tell me once my heart goes right

Take me home

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
(Whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world)

[III. The Pacific]

Sparkle my scenery
With turquoise waterfall
With beauty underneath
The Ever Free

Tuck me in beneath the blue
Beneath the pain, beneath the rain
Goodnight kiss for a child in time
Swaying blade my lullaby

On the shore we sat and hoped
Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you
Chose you all

""I'm afraid, I'm so afraid
Being raped again, and again, and again
I know I will die alone
But loved

You live long enough to hear the sound of guns
long enough to find yourself screaming every night
long enough to see your friends betray you

For years I've been strapped unto this altar
Now I only have three minutes and counting
I just wish the tide would catch me first and give
me a death I always longed for.""

[IV. Dark Passion Play]

2nd robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half - infanticide
The world will rejoice today
As the crows feast on the rotting poet

Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he's home in hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell

The morning dawned, upon his altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came

Getaway, runaway, fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
Save me
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
(Whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world)

""Today, in the year of our Lord 2005
Tuomas was called from the cares of the world
He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day
The music he wrote had too long been without silence

He was found naked and dead,
With a smile in his face, a pen and
1000 pages of erased text""

Save me

[V. Mother and Father]

Be still, my son
You're home
Oh when did you become so cold?
The blade will keep on descending
All you need is to feel my love

Search for beauty, find your shore
Try to save them all, bleed no more
You have such oceans within
In the end
I will always love you

The beginning"

I've got a habit of spitting
Quicker lyrics you know
You found me ripping the writtens
Out of the pages they sit in
And never once I get bitten
Because plagiarism is hidden
Which I would sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's on to the next saga
We drink the best lager
I never tried to win you over
Like your stepfather
I do my own thing now, and get respect after
And I'm avoiding cocaine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At sixteen years old, yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at the subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I'll take it back now
Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Trying to act like Jack Black when I bring 'em to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit
They try and take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens is from now on
I'll be ready to start again at the end of the song
Still their claiming that I handled it wrong
But then I never had an enemy, except for NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
I'm healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses
Rubber dinghy rapids
Keep this rapping a habit
And keep on passioning magic
I'm battling for respect
I don't know if I'll have it
This songs from the heart
Cover the planet
I'll take it back now
Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
Take it back now
Now I don't ever want to be perfect
Cause I'm a singer that you
Never want to see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone has to win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene
Giving me focus
Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change
Thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings
Avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics
And a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart break
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly
I need to let my liver be
And I say it again
Living life on the edge
With a closed hand full of friends
Is good advice from a man
Who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible
Achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely
You'll find me in the back
Room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
That's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now
Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
Mmmm c'mon and take it back love
C'mon and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No"

You know I bring that Detroit hood
You like it, and u feelin' good
You know that you want it

So get and up fight
You know that you want it

Boom, boom, boom, pow, I'm super fast
High heels, big deal, I'll kick your ass
They gunnin', they runnin' and that makes me mad
If you wanna rumble all you gotta do is ask
I'm a rude bitch, boy can you handle that?
I love to play but I don't really need a man
No daddy, no VISA, I got my own cash

Watching myself decaying, decaying
Falling from high spirits, spirits
I flee

Longing for finding my way out
Leaving myself, there's nothing left for me
The ruins are about to crumble down
The flame is dying by shivery winds of jet black skies
It reflects hatred in my eyes

Looking down, I see my ashes scattered around my grave
Angels whispering fire, no longer I'm alive
Settled down, I'm done with the trip to my kingdom come"

To watch you, to shield you or kill on demand
The choice he'd made he could not comprehend
His blood a grim secret they had to command
He's torn between his honor and the true love of his life
He prayed for both but was denied
So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed
Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind?
So many years have past, who are the noble and the wise?
Will all our sins be justified?
The curse of his powers tormented his life
Obeying the crown was a sinister price
His soul was tortured by love and by pain
He surely would flee but the oath made him stay
He's torn between his honor and the true love of his life
He prayed for both but was denied
So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed
Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind?
So many years have past, who are the noble and the wise?
Will all our sins be justified?
Please forgive me for the sorrow, for leaving you in fear
For the dreams we had to silence, that's all they'll ever be
Still I'll be the hand that serves you
Though you'll not see that it is me
So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed
Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind?
So many years have past, who are the noble and the wise?
